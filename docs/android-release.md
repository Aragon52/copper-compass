# Android app and GitHub releases

The Android app uses a native Android screen and Android `VpnService` with the bundled Xray core. It does not load or package the web interface. The first native screen accepts one VLESS, VMess, Trojan, or Shadowsocks link at a time, as well as Xray JSON; parsing happens on-device. Imported configuration is stored in private app preferences with Android backup disabled. The app also accepts shared text and direct configuration links. Public-server browsing, QR scanning, and Gemini recommendations remain web-only.

## Local Android project

Requirements: Java 21, Android Studio, and Android SDK platform/build tools.

```sh
bash scripts/fetch-android-core.sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Install the debug APK from `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Instrumentation tests are in `app/src/androidTest`; run them with `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` on a connected device or emulator. No web build or Capacitor sync is part of Android packaging. To regenerate Android launcher assets after changing the shared icon, run `npm run android:assets`.

## Configure GitHub releases

Add the following Actions secrets under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**:

- Secret `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: base64-encoded Android release keystore.
- Secret `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: keystore password.
- Secret `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: signing key alias.
- Secret `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: signing key password.

Generate a release keystore once and keep it backed up securely; losing it prevents updates from being signed as the same Android app:

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore netcon-release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000 -alias netcon
base64 -w 0 netcon-release.jks
```

Store the encoded output as `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and never commit the keystore or passwords. Push a new version tag such as `v1.0.4` to build, sign, verify, and attach both `Netcon.apk` and `Netcon.aab` to a GitHub Release:

```sh
git tag v1.0.4
git push origin v1.0.4
```

The release APK is signed for direct installation. The AAB is signed with the configured release key and can be uploaded to Google Play Console; complete Play App Signing enrollment and store listing there before publishing. Both artifacts use the tag as their version name, and their version code increments with each workflow run.
